    "text": "I’ve always felt that something was off with existing approaches to geospatial data science in other programming languages. I remember sitting in the beautiful Green library at Stanford after a short introductory course on GIS with R, and wondering why it had to be so “computer sciency”:\n\nWhat on Earth is a “LineString”? Isn’t a “Line” a geometric object with infinite length?\nWhy do I need to learn this low-level distinction between “raster” and “vector” data?\nAnd many other questions…\n\nAfter years of my PhD, I finally envisioned a more general approach, through the continuous design and development of the  framework for the  programming language. This book is the first attempt to share this vision with the broader scientific community.\nThere is a long journey until the technology reaches its full potential, but it is getting there! I hope that the book will enlighten you on some of those issues and that you can benefit from the open source software we built over the years.",

    "text": "Definition\n\n\n\n(Discrete) geospatial data is the combination of a table of attributes (or features) with a discretization of a geospatial domain. Each row (or measurement) in the table corresponds to an element (or geometry) in the discretization of the geospatial domain.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Table\nIn data science the most natural data structure for working with data is the table. Generally speaking, a table is any object that can be structured into rows containing measurements and columns representing variables. For example, Table 1.1 has 5 measurements of 4 variables:\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Example of table\n\n\n\n\n\nNAME\nAGE\nHEIGHT\nGENDER\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n34\n1.78m\nmale\n\n\nMary\n12\n1.56m\nfemale\n\n\nPaul\n23\n1.70m\nmale\n\n\nAnne\n39\n1.80m\nfemale\n\n\nKate\n28\n1.72m\nfemale\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Julia, the concept of table is formalized in Tables.jl by Quinn et al. (2023). The definition is independent of the machine representation, and various representations can co-exist in the language.\n\n\n1.1.2 Domain\nThe second definition that we need is that of a geospatial domain. In geosciences, questions are often formulated within a physical region of interest. This physical region can cover a small area of the surface of the Earth, the entire Earth surface, or any region of finite measure that can be discretized into smaller geometries (a.k.a. elements):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Coast line in Islay Province, Peru. View on Google Maps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Synthetic carbonate reservoir model by Correia et al. (2015). See UNISIM-II for more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Example of geospatial domains\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1 illustrates two very different examples of geospatial domains. The domain in Figure 1.1 (a) is widely studied in GIS books. It is a 2D domain that contemplates a small area near Islay Province, Peru. The domain in Figure 1.1 (b) on the other hand is not considered in traditional GIS literature. It is a 3D domain that has been discretized into hexahedron geometries.\nThe concept of geospatial domain is formalized in Meshes.jl by Hoffimann et al. (2021).\n\n\n1.1.3 Remarks\n\nImages like the one depicted in Figure 1.1 (a) are often implemented in terms of the array data structure. GIS books call it “raster data”, but we will avoid this term in our framework in order to obtain a more general set of tools.\nAccording to our definition of geospatial data, “raster data” is simply a table with colors as variables (e.g., RGB values) combined with a grid of quadrangle geometries. We illustrate this concept in Figure 1.2 by zooming in a satellite image of the Lena delta:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) “Raster data” of Lena delta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Zoom reveals quadrangle geometries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Quadrangle geometries in “raster data”\n\n\n\nThere are no constraints on the geometries used in the discretization of the geospatial domain. In Figure 1.3, Brazil is discretized into complex polygonal geometries that represent country states:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Brazil’s states represented with complex polygonal geometries. View on Google Maps.\n\n\n\nGIS books call it “vector data” because the geometries are stored as vectors of coordinates in memory. We will also avoid this term in our framework given that it only highlights an implementation detail.\n\nBefore we start discussing machine representation with actual Julia code, let’s make a final (pedantic) distinction between the words geospatial and spatial. These words mean different things in different communities:\n\nIn geosciences, an object is geospatial if it lives in physical space.\nIn statistics, a model is spatial if it exploits the vicinity of samples in the sample space.\n\nGiven that geospatial data science deals with both concepts, we must use these words carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn Geostatistical Learning, models can exploit both spaces to improve prediction performance, but that is out of the scope for this book.",

    "section": "1.2 Representation",
    "text": "1.2 Representation\nBased on the definition of geospatial data given in the previous section, we are now ready to proceed and discuss an efficient machine representation for it with actual Julia code.\n\n1.2.1 Table\nThe Julia language comes with two built-in table representations:\n\nNamed tuple of vectors\nVector of named tuples\n\nThe first representation focuses on the columns of the table:\n\ncoltable = (\n  NAME=[\"John\", \"Mary\", \"Paul\", \"Anne\", \"Kate\"],\n  AGE=[34, 12, 23, 39, 28],\n  HEIGHT=[1.78, 1.56, 1.70, 1.80, 1.72],\n  GENDER=[\"male\", \"female\", \"male\", \"female\", \"female\"]\n)\n\n(NAME = [\"John\", \"Mary\", \"Paul\", \"Anne\", \"Kate\"], AGE = [34, 12, 23, 39, 28], HEIGHT = [1.78, 1.56, 1.7, 1.8, 1.72], GENDER = [\"male\", \"female\", \"male\", \"female\", \"female\"])\n\n\nGiven that data science is often performed with entire columns, this column-major representation of a table is very convenient. The second representation focuses on the rows of the table:\n\nrowtable = [\n  (NAME=\"John\", AGE=34, HEIGHT=1.78, GENDER=\"male\"),\n  (NAME=\"Mary\", AGE=12, HEIGHT=1.56, GENDER=\"female\"),\n  (NAME=\"Paul\", AGE=23, HEIGHT=1.70, GENDER=\"male\"),\n  (NAME=\"Anne\", AGE=39, HEIGHT=1.80, GENDER=\"female\"),\n  (NAME=\"Kate\", AGE=28, HEIGHT=1.72, GENDER=\"female\")\n]\n\n5-element Vector{@NamedTuple{NAME::String, AGE::Int64, HEIGHT::Float64, GENDER::String}}:\n (NAME = \"John\", AGE = 34, HEIGHT = 1.78, GENDER = \"male\")\n (NAME = \"Mary\", AGE = 12, HEIGHT = 1.56, GENDER = \"female\")\n (NAME = \"Paul\", AGE = 23, HEIGHT = 1.7, GENDER = \"male\")\n (NAME = \"Anne\", AGE = 39, HEIGHT = 1.8, GENDER = \"female\")\n (NAME = \"Kate\", AGE = 28, HEIGHT = 1.72, GENDER = \"female\")\n\n\nThe row-major representation can be useful to process data that is potentially larger than the available computer memory, or infinite streams of data.\nAlthough these two representations come built-in with Julia, they lack basic functionality for data science. The most widely used table representation for data science in Julia is available in DataFrames.jl by Bouchet-Valat and Kamiński (2023).\n\nusing DataFrames\n\ndf = DataFrame(\n  NAME=[\"John\", \"Mary\", \"Paul\", \"Anne\", \"Kate\"],\n  AGE=[34, 12, 23, 39, 28],\n  HEIGHT=[1.78, 1.56, 1.70, 1.80, 1.72],\n  GENDER=[\"male\", \"female\", \"male\", \"female\", \"female\"]\n)\n\n\n\n5×4 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nNAME\nAGE\nHEIGHT\nGENDER\n\n\n\nString\nInt64\nFloat64\nString\n\n\n\n\n1\nJohn\n34\n1.78\nmale\n\n\n2\nMary\n12\n1.56\nfemale\n\n\n3\nPaul\n23\n1.7\nmale\n\n\n4\nAnne\n39\n1.8\nfemale\n\n\n5\nKate\n28\n1.72\nfemale\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis representation provides additional syntax for accessing rows and columns of the table:\n\ndf[1,:]\n\n\n\nDataFrameRow (4 columns)\n\n\n\nRow\nNAME\nAGE\nHEIGHT\nGENDER\n\n\n\nString\nInt64\nFloat64\nString\n\n\n\n\n1\nJohn\n34\n1.78\nmale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf[:,\"NAME\"]\n\n5-element Vector{String}:\n \"John\"\n \"Mary\"\n \"Paul\"\n \"Anne\"\n \"Kate\"\n\n\n\ndf[1:3,[\"NAME\",\"AGE\"]]\n\n\n\n3×2 DataFrame\n\n\n\nRow\nNAME\nAGE\n\n\n\nString\nInt64\n\n\n\n\n1\nJohn\n34\n\n\n2\nMary\n12\n\n\n3\nPaul\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.HEIGHT\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.78\n 1.56\n 1.7\n 1.8\n 1.72\n\n\n\ndf.\"HEIGHT\"\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.78\n 1.56\n 1.7\n 1.8\n 1.72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUnlike other languages, Julia makes a distinction between the the symbol :HEIGHT and the string \"HEIGHT\". The DataFrame representation supports both types for column names, but that is not always the case with other table representations.\n\n\nOther popular table representations in Julia are associated with specific file formats:\n\nCSV.File from CSV.jl (Quinn et al. 2023)\nXLSX.Worksheet from XLSX.jl\nDatabases from JuliaDatabases\n\nThe choice of table representation is a function of the application.\n\n\n1.2.2 Domain\nAll available domain representations come from the Meshes.jl module.\nLet’s start with a simple list of disconnected geometries:\n\nusing GeoStats\n\np = Point(1, 2)\ns = Segment((0, 2), (1, 3))\nt = Triangle((0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1))\nb = Ball((2, 2), 1)\n\ngeoms = [p, s, t, b]\n\n4-element Vector{Geometry{𝔼{2}, Cartesian2D{NoDatum, Quantity{Float64, 𝐋, Unitful.FreeUnits{(m,), 𝐋, nothing}}}}}:\n Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 2.0 m)\n Segment((x: 0.0 m, y: 2.0 m), (x: 1.0 m, y: 3.0 m))\n Triangle((x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m), (x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m), (x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n Ball(center: (x: 2.0 m, y: 2.0 m), radius: 1.0 m)\n\n\nBecause these geometries are unaware of each other, we place them into a GeometrySet, informally known in computational geometry as the “soup of geometries” data structure:\n\ngset = GeometrySet(geoms)\n\n4 GeometrySet\n├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 2.0 m)\n├─ Segment((x: 0.0 m, y: 2.0 m), (x: 1.0 m, y: 3.0 m))\n├─ Triangle((x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m), (x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m), (x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n└─ Ball(center: (x: 2.0 m, y: 2.0 m), radius: 1.0 m)\n\n\nNo advanced knowledge is required to start working with these geometries. For example, we can compute the length of the Segment, the area of the Triangle and the area of the Ball with:\n\nlength(s), area(t), area(b)\n\n(1.4142135623730951 m, 0.5 m^2, 3.141592653589793 m^2)\n\n\nMore generally, we can compute the measure of the geometries in the domain:\n\n[measure(g) for g in gset]\n\n4-element Vector{Quantity{Float64}}:\n                 0.0 m\n  1.4142135623730951 m\n               0.5 m^2\n 3.141592653589793 m^2\n\n\nIn the example above, we iterated over the domain to apply the function of interest, but we could have used Julia’s dot syntax for broadcasting the function over the geometries:\n\nmeasure.(gset)\n\n4-element Vector{Quantity{Float64}}:\n                 0.0 m\n  1.4142135623730951 m\n               0.5 m^2\n 3.141592653589793 m^2\n\n\nThe list of supported geometries is very comprehensive. It encompasses all geometries from the simple features standard and more. We will see more examples in the following chapters.\nOne of the main limitations of GIS software today is the lack of explicit representation of topology. A GeometrySet does not provide efficient topological relations (Floriani and Hui 2007), yet advanced geospatial data science requires the definition of geospatial domains where geometries are aware of their neighbors. Let’s illustrate this concept with the CartesianGrid domain:\n\ngrid = CartesianGrid(10, 10)\n\n10×10 CartesianGrid\n├─ minimum: Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n├─ maximum: Point(x: 10.0 m, y: 10.0 m)\n└─ spacing: (1.0 m, 1.0 m)\n\n\nWe can access the individual geometries of the domain as before:\n\ngrid[1]\n\nQuadrangle\n├─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m)\n└─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m)\n\n\nAnd even though we can manipulate this domain as if it was a “soup of geometries”, the major advantage in this abstraction is the underlying topology:\n\ntopo = topology(grid)\n\n10×10 GridTopology(aperiodic, aperiodic)\n\n\nThis data structure can be used by advanced users who wish to design algorithms with neighborhood information. We will cover this topic in a separate chapter. For now, keep in mind that working with the entire domain as opposed to with a vector or “soup of geometries” has major benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe CartesianGrid domain is lazy, meaning it only stores the start and end points of the grid together with the spacing between the elements. Therefore, we can easily create large 3D grids of Hexahedron geometries without consuming all available memory:\n\ngrid = CartesianGrid(10000, 10000, 10000)\n\n10000×10000×10000 CartesianGrid\n├─ minimum: Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m, z: 0.0 m)\n├─ maximum: Point(x: 10000.0 m, y: 10000.0 m, z: 10000.0 m)\n└─ spacing: (1.0 m, 1.0 m, 1.0 m)\n\n\n\ngrid[1]\n\nHexahedron\n├─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m, z: 0.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m, z: 0.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m, z: 0.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m, z: 0.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m, z: 1.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m, z: 1.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m, z: 1.0 m)\n└─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m, z: 1.0 m)\n\n\n\n\nIn computational geometry, a CartesianGrid is a specific type of mesh. It can only represent “flat” domains sampled regularly along each dimension (e.g., images). To represent domains with curvature such as terrain elevation models or complex 3D domains like the one in Figure 1.1 (b), we can use the SimpleMesh domain:\n\n# global vector of 2D points\npoints = [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0), (1.0, 1.0), (0.25, 0.5), (0.75, 0.5)]\n\n# connect the points into N-gons\nconnec = connect.([(1, 2, 6, 5), (2, 4, 6), (4, 3, 5, 6), (3, 1, 5)])\n\n# 2D mesh made of N-gon elements\nmesh = SimpleMesh(points, connec)\n\n4 SimpleMesh\n  6 vertices\n  ├─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n  ├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n  ├─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m)\n  ├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m)\n  ├─ Point(x: 0.25 m, y: 0.5 m)\n  └─ Point(x: 0.75 m, y: 0.5 m)\n  4 elements\n  ├─ Quadrangle(1, 2, 6, 5)\n  ├─ Triangle(2, 4, 6)\n  ├─ Quadrangle(4, 3, 5, 6)\n  └─ Triangle(3, 1, 5)\n\n\nThe connect function takes a tuple of indices and a geometry type, and produces a connectivity object. The geometry type can be omitted, in which case it is assumed to be a Ngon, i.e., a polygon with N sides:\n\nc = connect((1, 2, 3))\n\nTriangle(1, 2, 3)\n\n\nThis connectivity object can be materialized into an actual geometry with a vector of points:\n\nmaterialize(c, [Point(0, 0), Point(1, 0), Point(1, 1)])\n\nTriangle\n├─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n└─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m)\n\n\nThe SimpleMesh uses the materialize function above to construct geometries on the fly, similar to what we have seen with the CartesianGrid:\n\nmesh[1]\n\nQuadrangle\n├─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 0.75 m, y: 0.5 m)\n└─ Point(x: 0.25 m, y: 0.5 m)\n\n\nDon’t worry if you feel overwhelmed by these concepts. We are only sharing them here to give you an idea of how complex 3D domains are represented in the framework. You can do geospatial data science without ever having to operate with these concepts explicitly.\nLet’s make a few important remarks:\n\nFlexibility comes with a price. To construct a SimpleMesh of connected geometries we need to explicitly create a vector of vertices, and connect these vertices into geometries using their indices in the vector.\nGeometries in a SimpleMesh can be of different type. In the example, we have both Triangle and Quadrangle geometries in the domain. This is similar to what we had with GeometrySet, but now the geometries are connected.\nSimpleMesh are rarely constructed by hand. They are often the result of a sophisticated geometric processing pipeline that is already stored in a file on disk.\n\nThe last missing piece of the puzzle is the combination of tables with domains into geospatial data, which we discuss next.\n\n\n1.2.3 Data\nWouldn’t it be nice if we had a representation of geospatial data that behaved like a table as discussed in the Tables section, but preserved topological information as discussed in the Domains section? In the GeoStats.jl framework, this is precisely what we get with the georef function:\n\nusing GeoStats\n\ndf = DataFrame(\n  NAME=[\"John\", \"Mary\", \"Paul\", \"Anne\"],\n  AGE=[34.0, 12.0, 23.0, 39.0]u\"yr\",\n  HEIGHT=[1.78, 1.56, 1.70, 1.80]u\"m\",\n  GENDER=[\"male\", \"female\", \"male\", \"female\"]\n)\n\ngrid = CartesianGrid(2, 2)\n\ngeotable = georef(df, grid)\n\n\n4×5 GeoTable over 2×2 CartesianGrid\n\n\nNAME\nAGE\nHEIGHT\nGENDER\ngeometry\n\n\nCategorical\nContinuous\nContinuous\nCategorical\nQuadrangle\n\n\n[NoUnits]\n[yr]\n[m]\n[NoUnits]\n🖈 Cartesian{NoDatum}\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n34.0 yr\n1.78 m\nmale\nQuadrangle((x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\nMary\n12.0 yr\n1.56 m\nfemale\nQuadrangle((x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\nPaul\n23.0 yr\n1.7 m\nmale\nQuadrangle((x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m), ..., (x: 0.0 m, y: 2.0 m))\n\n\nAnne\n39.0 yr\n1.8 m\nfemale\nQuadrangle((x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m), ..., (x: 1.0 m, y: 2.0 m))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip for all users\n\n\n\nThe framework is integrated with the Unitful.jl module. To add the unit “meter” to the numeric value 1.0, we can write 1.0u\"m\". Similarly, we can add units to vectors of values:\n\n[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]u\"m\"\n\n3-element Vector{Quantity{Float64, 𝐋, Unitful.FreeUnits{(m,), 𝐋, nothing}}}:\n 1.0 m\n 2.0 m\n 3.0 m\n\n\nIt is also possible to load units explicitly to avoid the “u” prefix:\nusing Unitful: m, ft\n\n1.0m + 2.0ft\n\n\nThe function combines any table with any domain into a geospatial data representation that adheres to the Tables.jl interface. We call this representation a GeoTable to distinguish it from a standard table. Besides the original columns, the GeoTable has a special geometry column with the underlying domain:\n\nnames(geotable)\n\n5-element Vector{String}:\n \"NAME\"\n \"AGE\"\n \"HEIGHT\"\n \"GENDER\"\n \"geometry\"\n\n\nUnlike a standard table, the GeoTable creates geometries on the fly depending on the data access pattern. For example, we can request the first measurement of the GeoTable and it will automatically construct the corresponding Quadrangle:\n\ngeotable[1,:]\n\n(NAME = \"John\", AGE = 34.0 yr, HEIGHT = 1.78 m, GENDER = \"male\", geometry = Quadrangle((x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m)))\n\n\nIf we request a subset of measurements, the GeoTable will avoid unnecessary creation of geometries, and will instead return a view into the original data:\n\ngeotable[1:3,[\"NAME\",\"AGE\"]]\n\n\n3×3 GeoTable over 3 view(::CartesianGrid, 1:3)\n\n\nNAME\nAGE\ngeometry\n\n\nCategorical\nContinuous\nQuadrangle\n\n\n[NoUnits]\n[yr]\n🖈 Cartesian{NoDatum}\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n34.0 yr\nQuadrangle((x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\nMary\n12.0 yr\nQuadrangle((x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\nPaul\n23.0 yr\nQuadrangle((x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m), ..., (x: 0.0 m, y: 2.0 m))\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, if we request the entire geometry column, we get back the original domain:\n\ngeotable[:,\"geometry\"]\n\n2×2 CartesianGrid\n├─ minimum: Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n├─ maximum: Point(x: 2.0 m, y: 2.0 m)\n└─ spacing: (1.0 m, 1.0 m)\n\n\nBesides the data access patterns of the DataFrame, the GeoTable also provides an advanced method for retrieving all rows that intersect with a given geometry:\n\ngeotable[Segment((0, 0), (2, 0)), :]\n\n\n2×5 GeoTable over 2 view(::CartesianGrid, [1, 2])\n\n\nNAME\nAGE\nHEIGHT\nGENDER\ngeometry\n\n\nCategorical\nContinuous\nContinuous\nCategorical\nQuadrangle\n\n\n[NoUnits]\n[yr]\n[m]\n[NoUnits]\n🖈 Cartesian{NoDatum}\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n34.0 yr\n1.78 m\nmale\nQuadrangle((x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\nMary\n12.0 yr\n1.56 m\nfemale\nQuadrangle((x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method is very useful to narrow the region of interest and quickly discard all measurements that are outside of it. For instance, it is common to discard all “pixels” outside of a polygon before exporting the geotable to a file on disk.\nNotice that the GeoTable representation is general enough to accommodate both “raster data” and “vector data” in traditional GIS. We can create very large rasters because the CartesianGrid is lazy:\n\ngeoref(\n  (\n    R=rand(1000000),\n    G=rand(1000000),\n    B=rand(1000000)\n  ),\n  CartesianGrid(1000, 1000)\n)\n\n\n1000000×4 GeoTable over 1000×1000 CartesianGrid\n\n\nR\nG\nB\ngeometry\n\n\nContinuous\nContinuous\nContinuous\nQuadrangle\n\n\n[NoUnits]\n[NoUnits]\n[NoUnits]\n🖈 Cartesian{NoDatum}\n\n\n\n\n0.562724\n0.351337\n0.0768295\nQuadrangle((x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 0.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n0.391008\n0.0252122\n0.515234\nQuadrangle((x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n0.336468\n0.710305\n0.86022\nQuadrangle((x: 2.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 2.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n0.0229674\n0.180289\n0.421353\nQuadrangle((x: 3.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 3.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n0.181861\n0.010117\n0.21966\nQuadrangle((x: 4.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 4.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n0.523128\n0.887107\n0.425416\nQuadrangle((x: 5.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 5.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n0.0160605\n0.342339\n0.107127\nQuadrangle((x: 6.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 6.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n0.929868\n0.587595\n0.180816\nQuadrangle((x: 7.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 7.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n0.53181\n0.843373\n0.566835\nQuadrangle((x: 8.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 8.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n0.746133\n0.0375201\n0.983074\nQuadrangle((x: 9.0 m, y: 0.0 m), ..., (x: 9.0 m, y: 1.0 m))\n\n\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n⋮\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd can load vector geometries from files that store simple features using the GeoIO.jl module:\n\nusing GeoIO\n\nGeoIO.load(\"data/countries.geojson\")\n\n\n177×3 GeoTable over 177 GeometrySet\n\n\nCOUNTRY\nREGION\ngeometry\n\n\nCategorical\nCategorical\nMultiPolygon\n\n\n[NoUnits]\n[NoUnits]\n🖈 GeodeticLatLon{WGS84Latest}\n\n\n\n\nFiji\nMelanesia\nMulti(3×PolyArea)\n\n\nTanzania\nEastern Africa\nMulti(1×PolyArea)\n\n\nW.

This representation is universal, meaning it combines the “raster” and “vector” representations found in traditional GIS.\nA GeoTable provides all the data access patterns of a DataFrame. In particular, it supports the syntax geotable[rows,cols] without expensive copies of geometries.\nWorking with geospatial domains as opposed to working with vectors of disconnected geometries has major benefits. In particular, it preserves topological information.\n\nIt is very convenient to manipulate a GeoTable as if it was a DataFrame. Nevertheless, we will learn that advanced geospatial data science requires higher-level constructs to preserve geospatial information.

    "text": "3.3 Rationale\nNow that we have set expectations for our interface with GIS, let’s address an important question that many readers might have coming from other communities:\n\nDo we gain anything by not adhering to programming interfaces?\n\nThe answer is an emphatic YES! It means that we have total freedom to innovate and improve the representation of various geometries and geospatial domains with Julia’s amazing type system. To give a simple example, let’s take a look at the Triangle geometry:\n\nt = Triangle((0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1))\n\nTriangle\n├─ Point(x: 0.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n├─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 0.0 m)\n└─ Point(x: 1.0 m, y: 1.0 m)\n\n\nIf we treated this geometry as a generic polygon represented by a vector of vertices in memory, like it is done in GeoInterface.jl for example, we wouldn’t be able to dispatch optimized code that is only valid for a triangle:\n\n@code_llvm isconvex(t)\n\n;  @ /home/runner/.julia/packages/Meshes/OF9k2/src/predicates/isconvex.jl:57 within `isconvex`\ndefine i8 @julia_isconvex_4480([1 x [3 x [1 x [1 x [2 x [1 x double]]]]]]* nocapture readonly %0) #0 {\ntop:\n  ret i8 1\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn Julia, the macro @code_llvm shows the underlying code sent to the LLVM compiler. In this case, the code is the single line ret i8 1, which is the instruction to return the constant integer 1.\n\n\nNotice how the isconvex function is compiled away to the constant 1 (i.e. true) when called on the triangle. The code for a generic polygon is much more complicated and requires runtime checks that are too expensive to afford, especially in 3D.\nAnother reason to not adhere to a generic interface is that we can store information in the geometry types themselves (e.g., coordinate reference system) that is relevant to design advanced scientific visualization features illustrated in the previous chapter, and to dispatch specialized algorithms from geodesic geometry.\nHaving cleared that up, we will now proceed to the last foundational chapter of the book, which covers the advanced geometric processing features of the framework.",

This is where the topology is useful:\n\ntopo = topology(grid)\n\n2×3 GridTopology(aperiodic, aperiodic)\n\n\nWe can create an Adjacency topological relation to find which quadrangles are adjacent to quadrangle 1 in the domain:\n\nA = Adjacency{2}(topo)\n\nA(1)\n\n(2, 3)\n\n\nThe number 2 that appears in the Adjacency relation is known as the parametric dimension. In this case, we are interested in the adjacency of 2D geometries. The quadrangle 1 is the first quadrangle in the bottom-left corner of the grid, and it is adjacent to quadrangles 2 and 3. As another example, the quadrangle 3 is adjacent to quadrangles 4, 1 and 5:\n\nA(3)\n\n(4, 1, 5)\n\n\nIn order to query the adjacency of vertices, we create a relation with parametric dimension 0:\n\nA = Adjacency{0}(topo)\n\nA(1)\n\n(2, 4)\n\n\nWe can also query the vertices that are on the boundary of a given quadrangle with the Boundary topological relation. In this case, we specify the parametric dimension of the input and output geometries:\n\nB = Boundary{2,0}(topo)\n\nB(1)\n\n(1, 2, 5, 4)\n\n\nTopological relations are an advanced feature of the framework.

Let’s quickly review what we learned so far:\n\nThe main concept in geospatial data science is the concept of geospatial data, represented in the GeoStats.jl framework as geotables over geospatial domains.\nThe geotable representation generalizes traditional GIS representations (“raster” vs. “vector”), and enables an unified approach to visualization and manipulation of geospatial data.\nIt is still possible to interface with existing GIS technology via input and output of files using the GeoIO.jl module. A typical workflow will load GIS data at the beginning of a script, and save the result of the analysis at the end of the script.\nGeometric processing doesn’t need to be complicated. It should be fun and read like math. If it feels “computer sciency”, that is a limitation of the software and programming language.\n\nWe are finally ready to learn the advanced features of the framework.

We will cover some of these transforms in more detail in Part V of the book with real data. In the following examples we illustrate the most basic statistical transforms with synthetic data.\nThe Sample transform can be used to sample rows of the geotable at random, with or without replacement depending on the replace option. Other options are available such as rng to set the random number generator and ordered to preserve the order of rows in the original geotable:\n\ngt |&gt; Sample(1000, replace=false) |&gt; viewer\n\n┌ Warning: Found `resolution` in the theme when creating a `Scene`. The `resolution` keyword for `Scene`s and `Figure`s has been deprecated. Use `Figure(; size = ...` or `Scene(; size = ...)` instead, which better reflects that this is a unitless size and not a pixel resolution. The key could also come from `set_theme!` calls or related theming functions.\n└ @ Makie ~/.julia/packages/Makie/We6MY/src/scenes.jl:227\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSimilar to Filter and Sort, the Sample transform is lazy. It simply stores the indices of sampled rows for future construction of the new geotable.\n\n\nThe Center and Scale transforms can be used to standardize the range of values in a geotable. Aliases are provided for specific types of Scale such as MinMax and Interquartile. We can use the describe function to visualize basic statistics before and after the transforms:\n\ngt |&gt; describe\n\nTable with 6 columns and 4 rows:\n     variable  mean         minimum   median      maximum  nmissing\n   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n 1 │ a         3.0168       -3.42966  2.021       12.9249  0\n 2 │ b         -0.0531197   -12.1775  -0.0728199  11.4693  0\n 3 │ c         -0.00559705  -3.8006   -0.002596   4.57976  0\n 4 │ d         -0.00912014  -4.30063  0.00191142  4.40251  0\n\n\n\ngt |&gt; Center(\"a\") |&gt; describe\n\nTable with 6 columns and 4 rows:\n     variable  mean         minimum   median      maximum  nmissing\n   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n 1 │ a         3.63798e-16  -6.44646  -0.995795   9.90809  0\n 2 │ b         -0.0531197   -12.1775  -0.0728199  11.4693  0\n 3 │ c         -0.00559705  -3.8006   -0.002596   4.57976  0\n 4 │ d         -0.00912014  -4.30063  0.00191142  4.40251  0\n\n\n\ngt |&gt; MinMax() |&gt; describe\n\nTable with 6 columns and 4 rows:\n     variable  mean      minimum  median    maximum  nmissing\n   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n 1 │ a         0.394169  0.0      0.333281  1.0      0\n 2 │ b         0.512729  0.0      0.511896  1.0      0\n 3 │ c         0.452845  0.0      0.453203  1.0      0\n 4 │ d         0.493099  0.0      0.494367  1.0      0\n\n\nThe ZScore transform is similar to the Scale transform, but it uses the mean and the standard deviation to standardize the range:\n\ngt |&gt; ZScore() |&gt; describe\n\nTable with 6 columns and 4 rows:\n     variable  mean         minimum   median       maximum  nmissing\n   ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n 1 │ a         1.81899e-16  -1.8824   -0.290777    2.89322  0\n 2 │ b         1.49214e-17  -4.7117   -0.00765577  4.47775  0\n 3 │ c         8.52651e-18  -3.77559  0.0029857    4.5619   0\n 4 │ d         1.35003e-17  -3.69645  0.00950191   3.7999   0\n\n\nAnother important univariate transform is the Quantile transform, which can be used to convert empirical distribution in a column of the geotable to any given distribution from Distributions.jl by Lin et al.

Some of these transforms can be useful to repair problematic geometries acquired from sensors in the real world.\nThe Repair transform is parameterized by an integer K that identifies the repair to be performed. For example, Repair{0}() is a transform that removes duplicated vertices and faces in a domain represented by a mesh. The Repair{9}() on the other hand fixes the orientation of rings in polygonal areas so that the external boundary is oriented counter clockwise and the inner boundaries are oriented clockwise. The list of available repairs will continue to grow with the implementation of new geometric algorithms in the framework.\nTo understand why geometric transforms are more general than coordinate transforms, let’s consider the following polygonal area with holes:\n\nouter = [(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0)]\nhole1 = [(0.2, 0.2), (0.2, 0.4), (0.4, 0.4), (0.4, 0.2)]\nhole2 = [(0.6, 0.2), (0.6, 0.4), (0.8, 0.4), (0.8, 0.2)]\npoly  = PolyArea([outer, hole1, hole2])\n\nviz(poly)\n\n┌ Warning: Found `resolution` in the theme when creating a `Scene`.

In order to leverage the large number of transforms implemented in the framework, all we need to do is load our geospatial data as a geotable using georef or GeoIO.jl.\nSome additional remarks:\n\nOne of the major advantages of transforms compared to traditional row/column access in data science is that they preserve geospatial information. There is no need to keep track of indices in arrays to repeatedly reattach values to geometries.\nTransforms can be organized into three classes—feature, geometric and geospatial—depending on how they operate with the values and the domain of the geotable:\n\nFeature transforms operate on the values. They include column selection, data cleaning, statistical analysis and any transform designed for traditional Tables.jl.\nGeometric transforms operate on the domain. They include coordinate transforms that simply modify the coordinates of points as well as more advanced transforms that can change the topology of the domain.\nGeospatial transforms operate on both the values and domain. They include geostatistical transforms and transforms that use other columns besides the geometry column to produce new columns and geometries.\n\n\nIn the next chapters, we will review map projections with the Proj coordinate transform, and will introduce one of the greatest features of the framework known as transform pipelines.\n\n\n\n\nHoffimann, Júlio, and Bianca Zadrozny. 2019. “Efficient Variography with Partition Variograms.” Computers & Geosciences 131: 52–59. https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2019.06.013.\n\n\nKoolen, Twan, Yuto Horikawa, Andy Ferris, Claire Foster, awbsmith, ryanelandt, Jan Weidner, et al. 2023. “JuliaGeometry/Rotations.jl: V1.6.0.” Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8366010.\n\n\nLin, Dahua, David Widmann, Simon Byrne, John Myles White, Andreas Noack, Mathieu Besançon, Douglas Bates, et al. 2023. “JuliaStats/Distributions.jl: V0.25.100.” Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8224988.\n\n\nThompson, William. 2023. “PairPlots.jl Beautiful and Flexible Visualizations of High Dimensional Data.” https://sefffal.github.io/PairPlots.jl/dev.",

    "text": "7.1 Motivation\nThe pipe operator |&gt; in Julia is very convenient for sequential application of functions. Given an input x, we can type x |&gt; f1 |&gt; f2 to apply functions f1 and f2 in sequence, in a way that is equivalent to f2(f1(x)) or, alternatively, to the function composition (f2 ∘ f1)(x). Its syntax can drastically improve code readability when the number of functions is large. However, the operator has a major limitation in the context of geospatial data science: it evaluates all intermediate results as soon as the data is inserted in the pipe. This is known in computer science as eager evaluation.\nTaking the expression above as an example, the operator will first evaluate f1(x) and store the result in a variable y. After f1 is completed, the operator evaluates f2(y) and produces the final (desired) result. If y requires a lot of computer memory as it is usually the case with large geotables, the application of the pipeline will be slow.\nAnother evaluation strategy, known as lazy evaluation, consists of building the entire pipeline without the data in it. The major advantage of this strategy is that it can analyze the functions, and potentially simplify the code before evaluation. For example, the pipeline cos → acos can be replaced by the much simpler pipeline identity for some values of the input x.",

Let’s quickly review what we learned so far:\n\nTransforms and pipelines are powerful tools to achieve reproducible geospatial data science.\nThe operators → and ⊔ can be used to build lazy pipelines. After a pipeline is built, it can be applied to different geotables, which may have different types of geospatial domain.\nLazy pipelines can always be optimized for computational performance, and the Julia language really thrives to dispatch the appropriate optimizations when they are available.\nMap projections are specific types of coordinate transforms. They can be combined with many other transforms in the framework to produce advanced geostatistical visualizations.\n\nThere is a long journey until the technology reaches its full potential. The good news is that Julia code is easy to read and modify, and you can become an active contributor after just a few weeks working with the language. We invite you to contribute new transforms and optimizations as soon as you feel comfortable with the framework.",

For example:\nThe word “where” is often present in these questions to indicate that answers must be georeferenced. If the variable of interest is already present in the geotable, then we can effectively answer “where” questions using the viewer and the Filter transform from previous chapters:\nIf the variable of interest is not present in the geotable, or if the “where” word is not present in the original question, then there will be some reference to “geospatial units” on which geostatistics must be computed. These questions can be answered with a geospatial version of the split-apply-combine strategy (Wickham 2011) from data science. Our framework provides the @groupby, @transform and @combine macros to split-apply-combine geotables.",

Hence, the need to join these geotables before attempting to @groupby, @transform and @combine the information.\nLet’s consider a simple example where we are given two geotables, one containing people who shared their latitude and longitude coordinates:\ntable = (\n  NAME=[\"John\", \"Mary\", \"Paul\", \"Anne\", \"Kate\"],\n  AGE=[34.0, 12.0, 23.0, 39.0, 28.0]u\"yr\",\n  HEIGHT=[1.78, 1.56, 1.70, 1.80, 1.72]u\"m\",\n  LATITUDE=[-22.96710361241228, 37.42773662442142, -27.486220858775997, 39.90358408375064, -3.847311538763359],\n  LONGITUDE=[-43.17891118844475, -122.17007072663823, 153.04380578036657, 116.40764745941036, -32.411372812211226]\n)\n\npeople = georef(table, (:LONGITUDE, :LATITUDE)) |&gt; Proj(PlateCarree)\n\n\n5×4 GeoTable over 5 PointSet\n\n\nNAME\nAGE\nHEIGHT\ngeometry\n\n\nCategorical\nContinuous\nContinuous\nPoint\n\n\n[NoUnits]\n[yr]\n[m]\n🖈 PlateCarree{WGS84Latest}\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n34.0 yr\n1.78 m\n(x: -4.80665e6 m, y: -2.55669e6 m)\n\n\nMary\n12.0 yr\n1.56 m\n(x: -1.35999e7 m, y: 4.16644e6 m)\n\n\nPaul\n23.0 yr\n1.7 m\n(x: 1.70368e7 m, y: -3.05975e6 m)\n\n\nAnne\n39.0 yr\n1.8 m\n(x: 1.29584e7 m, y: 4.44205e6 m)\n\n\nKate\n28.0 yr\n1.72 m\n(x: -3.60802e6 m, y: -4.28281e5 m)\nAnd another containing countries in the world according to the Natural Earth project:\nusing GeoIO\n\ncountries = GeoIO.load(\"data/countries.geojson\", numbertype = Float64) |&gt; Proj(PlateCarree)\n\n\n177×3 GeoTable over 177 GeometrySet\n\n\nCOUNTRY\nREGION\ngeometry\n\n\nCategorical\nCategorical\nMultiPolygon\n\n\n[NoUnits]\n[NoUnits]\n🖈 PlateCarree{WGS84Latest}\n\n\n\n\nFiji\nMelanesia\nMulti(3×PolyArea)\n\n\nTanzania\nEastern Africa\nMulti(1×PolyArea)\n\n\nW.

The default predicate in geojoin is the intersects function that we covered in previous chapters.\nNotice that Kate’s “COUNTRY” and “REGION” are missing. That is because Kate lives in the Fernando de Noronha island, which is not present in the countries geotable. To retain just those people for which the geometric predicate evaluates true, we can use a different kind of geojoin known as :inner:\n\ngeojoin(people, countries, kind = :inner)\n\n\n4×6 GeoTable over 4 view(::PointSet, [1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n\nNAME\nAGE\nHEIGHT\nCOUNTRY\nREGION\ngeometry\n\n\nCategorical\nContinuous\nContinuous\nCategorical\nCategorical\nPoint\n\n\n[NoUnits]\n[yr]\n[m]\n[NoUnits]\n[NoUnits]\n🖈 PlateCarree{WGS84Latest}\n\n\n\n\nJohn\n34.0 yr\n1.78 m\nBrazil\nSouth America\n(x: -4.80665e6 m, y: -2.55669e6 m)\n\n\nMary\n12.0 yr\n1.56 m\nUnited States of America\nNorthern America\n(x: -1.35999e7 m, y: 4.16644e6 m)\n\n\nPaul\n23.0 yr\n1.7 m\nAustralia\nAustralia and New Zealand\n(x: 1.70368e7 m, y: -3.05975e6 m)\n\n\nAnne\n39.0 yr\n1.8 m\nChina\nEastern Asia\n(x: 1.29584e7 m, y: 4.44205e6 m)\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the :left kind is used.

In geojoin, geometric predicate functions are applied to the geometry column of geotables.\nThe tablejoin function can be used for database-style join between a geotable and a simple table (e.g., DataFrame). The result will be a new geotable over a subset of geometries from the first argument. Please check the documentation for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip for all users\n\n\n\nBesides geojoin, the framework also provides vertical and horizontal concatenation of geotables.

    "text": "10.3 Remarks\nThis chapter is definitely one of the most challenging ones for those with little background in geostatistics. Let’s make a few important remarks to summarize what we learned:\n\nGeospatial correlation can be represented with different functions, including the correlogram, the covariance and the variogram functions. Among these functions the variogram is the most general and easy to interpret as a measure of “spread” in the hscatter plot.\nThe variogram value \\(\\gamma(h)\\) represents the expected variation of a variable that is \\(h\\) units of distance from a reference point. It usually starts at \\(\\gamma(0) = 0\\), reaches a sill value \\(\\sigma^2\\) near the range and stays at this value as \\(h \\to \\infty\\).\nThe selection of an appropriate theoretical variogram model for interpolation of geospatial data is often based on a two-step procedure. First, we estimate the EmpiricalVariogram, and then we fit a theoretical model. The most widely used models are the GaussianVariogram, the SphericalVariogram and the ExponentialVariogram.\n\nIn the next chapter, we will learn how to perform geospatial interpolation with the selected theoretical variogram model.\n\n\n\n\nChilès, Jean-Paul, and Pierre Delfiner. 2012.

    "text": "11.4 Congratulations!\nCongratulations on finishing Part IV of the book. The interpolation models introduced here are simple, yet very useful. Before we start our journey with real-world applications of the framework, let’s review what we learned:\n\nGeospatial interpolation can be achieved with the Interpolate and InterpolateNeighbors transforms, and geostatistical models such as IDW and Kriging.\nModels such as Kriging exploit geospatial correlation to improve interpolation results. We can extract this information from samples using a two-step procedure:\n\nEstimate the EmpiricalVariogram from the available samples\nPerform fit of theoretical model with result from previous step\n\nInterpolate and InterpolateNeighbors are examples of geostatistical transforms. They can be easily inserted in more advanced pipelines as discussed in Part II.\n\nIn the next chapters, we will use the framework that we learned with real data to illustrate how advanced geospatial data science can be done with just a few lines of code. Once a solution is written in terms of the high-level tools covered in previous chapters, it is trivial to improve computational performance in pure Julia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFeature and performance requests are very welcome.

Among other things, we learned how to\n\nPerform simple economic assessment based on grades and metallurgical recoveries estimated at mining blocks using simple interpolation of transformed variables from drill hole samples.\nUse the tools covered in previous chapters to localize regions of interest in the mineral deposit.\n\nAlthough the mathematical model presented here is simple, it is what most mining companies do. There is opportunity to improve these types of estimates with more sophisticated geospatial data science pipelines.\n\n\n\n\nAitchison, J. 1982. “The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data.” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
